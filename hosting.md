# Hosting a LDK Review Club Meeting

## How to Choose a PR

- The purpose of PR Review Club is to help new contributors learn about the
  LDK codebase and the process of contributing to the project. Select a PR
  that is likely to be instructive or interesting. Don't select a PR just because
  you want it to be merged soon! You may even select a PR that is already merged.

- The PRs discussed at review club should span a range of complexity
  and difficulty levels, in order to cater to attendees with a variety of
  different experience levels. Having some meetings on basic PRs and others
  on more complex PRs ensures that there's something for everyone.

- Generally, try to pick PRs that don't require a very high level of contextual
  knowledge, since it's difficult to introduce a lot of concepts in a one hour
  meeting.

- The appropriate amount of code change to discuss depends on the complexity of
  the code. It might be fine to discuss 10-20 lines of code if the change is
  very subtle or has complex interactions. If the change is more straightforward,
  then it might be fine to discuss 100+ lines of code change. If the PR seems too
  large to cover in a meeting, consider only discussing a subset of the commits,
  or breaking up the discussion over multiple meetings.

- It's fine to discuss a PR that you opened yourself. After all, you probably
  know more about it than anyone else!

## Before the Meeting

- Consider contacting the PR author to let them know that you're going to
  talk about their PR in the review club. They'll probably be happy that you're
  interested in their PR and may be prepared to answer questions and give
  you more context. They may even want to join the meeting themselves.

- Post notes and questions on the Friday the week before the meeting.
  That gives attendees time to review the PR and prepare for the meeting. See the
  [Making a New Post](#making-a-new-post) section below for how to make a post.

- Prepare a range of questions from basic to advanced. The review club is a way
  to help new developers learn. There should be something for everyone.

- In the notes and meeting, don't just talk about the mechanical code changes.
  Other important aspects to consider are:

  - The motivation for the PR.
  - The historical context of the PR (why things in the code are the way they
    are currently, and what PRs have touched that part of the code base in the past).
  - How to review and test the changes.
  - Advantages and disadvantages of this approach compared to alternative approaches.
  - Potential bugs reviewers might want to look out for.
  - Fun Rust things.

- If you refer to yourself in the notes, use third person narrative
  (e.g. your name or GitHub profile) rather than first person ("I").

- Don't spoon-feed the attendees. Give them pointers for
  where to look in the codebase/GitHub/documentation, and let them do their
  own research from there.

- When linking to code, use stable links that won't break later:

  - for links to code in the main branch, link to a recent commit hash in
    the main branch of lightningdevkit/rust-lightning, e.g.
    [https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/34354571/lightning/src/ln/functional_test_utils.rs#L116](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/34354571/lightning/src/ln/functional_test_utils.rs#L116).
    You can use a short (8 character) commit id.

    **REASON**: linking directly to main
    isn't stable because line numbers/files change over time.

- Thorough preparation will really pay off. Taking the time to deeply
  understand the PR will make you feel more relaxed during the meeting.

- It can be useful to write out some anticipated answers/links/references
  before the meeting so you don't have to type them in the moment.

#### Making a New Post

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks) the website repository [located on GitHub](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-review-club).

To make a new post, run the following Ruby make command from the website directory:

```shell
rake posts:new -- -p PR_NUMBER -h HOST_USERNAME -d YYYY-MM-DD
```

The `-p` (`pr`)  and `-h` (`host`) arguments are required. The `-d` (`date`)
argument is optional; if no date is passed the meeting date will be set by default
to next Friday.

The `host` argument is your GitHub username.

This command will create a new markdown file for the post, with metadata and
initial Notes and Questions headers.

For full help on the command, run

```shell
rake posts:new -- --help
```

## In the Meeting

- Come with the mindset that the attendees are people who are as smart as you,
  but don't have the context that you do in Lightning protocol development or
  the LDK codebase.

- Start the meeting with "hi" from everyone so you know
  who's at their keyboard and paying attention.

- It's nice to remind people of some of our meeting conventions at the start:

  - Attendees don't have to ask to ask a question (e.g. "I have a question
    about x but I don't know if it's on-topic?"). They should just go ahead and
    ask. If it's off-topic, the host will say so.

  - The host is there to help moderate, not to lead. Attendees don't need to wait
    for the host to ask a specific question â€” they can just jump in at any point.

- A quick poll at the start ("Did everyone get a chance to review the PR? How
  about a quick y/n from everyone") establishes who will probably be
  asking/answering the more interesting questions.

- Move quickly at the start of the meeting to get to the interesting parts of
  the PR as soon as possible â€” preferably within 2 or 3 minutes.

- Don't worry if people haven't had a chance to review the PR yet. This
  is a voluntary meeting and most people have a lot of other commitments.

- Once the meeting has reached the challenging questions,
  it sometimes feels like there are long stretches of silence and no one
  is out there. Be patient. It takes people a bit of time to formulate their
  thoughts and type them out.

- Be encouraging! For many people, asking questions or volunteering an answer
  can be intimidating. People are there to learn. Try to create an environment
  where they feel safe to ask any questions and where they can attempt to answer without fear.

- Keep an eye on the clock, and try to wrap up the session at the end of the
  hour. Even if you're happy to continue beyond the hour, some of the attendees
  might have hard stops.

- Have fun, and pat yourself on the back! ðŸš€

## After the Meeting

Let one of the review club maintainers know that the meeting is over. They'll
take care of updating the website.

#### Updating the website

_This process is done by the review club maintainers_

- Change the `status` of the meeting post from `upcoming` to `past`.
  ```diff
  -status: upcoming
  +status: past
  ```

- Add the first 7 characters of the PR commit hash at HEAD to the meeting post.
  ```diff
  -commit:
  +commit: eebaca7
  ```
