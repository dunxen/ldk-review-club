## Notes

* LDK currently supports the legacy [`update_fee`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/301efc8a81720655b63b0b3b5bdada670ea088cc/lightning/src/ln/channelmanager.rs#L3649) protocol to adjust the feerate of the pre-signed transaction in function of mempool congestions.
* [#1689](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1689) brings the first pieces for the anchor output support protocol, aiming to offer dynamic fee-bumping by leveraging [Child-Pay-For-Parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp/) to LDK users.
* A new event `BumpChannelClose` is introduced to signal to users the necessity to attach a fee-bumping CPFP to a pending commitment transactions, waiting block inclusion.

## Questions

1. How the [`update_fee`](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#updating-fees-update_fee) mechanism is working ? What are the limits of this fee-bumping mechanism with
pre-signed Lightning transactions (e.g [additional fee buffer](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/740)) ?
2. How the [anchor output idea](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2018-November/016518.html) aimed to improve fee-prediction issues in contracting applications like Lightning ?
3. What is the [role of the mempool](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Mempool-and-mining) in a full-node implementation and why it was necessary to introduce the [carve-out](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681) ? What are the limits of the carve-out ?
4. Additionally of the mempool acceptance changes, why the scripts of the [anchor output transactions](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/688#issuecomment-549835175) were modified ?
5. How the `to_local_anchor` and `to_remote_anchor` outputs [scripts](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#to_local_anchor-and-to_remote_anchor-output-option_anchors) are derivable by a third-party and why it has been designed that way ?
6. Why [`option_zero_htlc_tx_fee`](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/824) was introduced ?
