## Notes

_Notes to follow soon!_

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
1. What are the advantages of having a single map for unfunded and funded channel types per peer? What are the disadvantages?
1. We still want different types to differentiate between different unfunded and funded channels, how do we manage to have (currently) three different channel types
   in a single `HashMap`?
1. We'd like to introduce a proper type for channel IDs in LDK, as seen in [PR 2485](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/2485). If we further differentiate
   between channel types, such as having separate types for random V1 `temporary_channel_id`'s, txid-based V1 `channel_id`s, zero-XORed V2 `temporary_channel_id`s, and XORed V2 `channel_id`s,
   how would we handle this for keys, or is it best to stick to just using plain `[u8; 32]`s in the `channel_by_id` map?
1. What is the current phase of the moon? Please only answer with an emoji.
