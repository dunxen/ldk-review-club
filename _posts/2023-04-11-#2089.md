_Notes and questions to follow soon!_

## Notes
* PR2089 make it easy for users of LDK to be able to bump the fees of their local commitment and HTLC transactions
  thanks to anchor outputs and [Child-Pays-For-Parent](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/cpfp) (CPFP) fee-bumping.
* An event handler for the `BumpTransactionEvent` is introduced covering the cases of a pending unilateral close and
  HTLC resolution with the `ChannelClose` and `HTLCResolution` event variants respectively.

## Questions
1. Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, or NACK?
1. On which two objects are `Event`s exposed to a user of LDK? What convenience object does LDK provide to ensure that
   these events get processed periodically and how does a user specify the action taken for each event?
1. Users need to implement one of two `trait`s in order for LDK to make use of their confirmed UTXOs for fee-bumping
   in the `BumpTransactionEventHandler`. What are these two traits and what are the differences between them?
1. What strategy is proposed for LDK to use for coin selection when it is required to do so for fee-bumping? What are some
   other strategies for coin selection that exist? Are they worth consideration?
1. What's the purpose of exposing `pending_htlcs` in `BumpTransactionEvent::ChannelClose`?
