## Notes

* In [PR 2476] the [`AvailableBalances::balance_msat`] field, which caused confusion due to its strange computation, was removed in favour of
  using `ChannelMonitor::get_claimable_balances` which is more straightforward for most use-cases and indicates balances claimable by the holder
  after taking on-chain fees into account.
* In [PR 2333] the `Balance::claimable_amount_satoshis` method was added, which excluded balances that we are unsure can be claimed.
  This makes sense on the surface, however, in the case of forwarding an HTLC, we know that we would either be able to claim the timeout balance from
  downstream or the preimage balance from upstream. Neither of these would be included in this calculation while the forwarded payment was still pending
  and not timed out.
* [PR 2618] (this PR) will include the timeout balance (`MaybeTimeoutClaimableHTLC`) but only in the case of forwarded payments. This offers a more accurate
  view of the claimable balance.
