## Notes

BOLT 12 Offers essentially provide a way for a Lightning node to receive payments through the use of a static identifier (they can be long-lived).
Offers do not replace BOLT 11 invoices, in fact, they work in tandem. Readers of an offer will be able to request invoices via [onion messages]
using a [blinded path] to the creator of the offer.

PR [#2294] introduces message handling for offers, so that LDK and also adds support for actually replying to onion messages which is an essential
part of the offer protocol.
