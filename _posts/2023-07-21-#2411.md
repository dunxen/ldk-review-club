## Notes

* In general for each hop in a route a sender wishes to construct, they need to create a shared secret for each, including the final node.
  The sender already knows the the public keys of all the hops (it's their node IDs), and generates a random `sessionkey` (`session_priv` in LDK)
  which is used as the ephemeral private key for the first hop `ek_1` in the route. Multiplying by the `secp256k1` generator point, the ephemeral public
  key, `epk_1` is derived. ECDH is then used to compute a shared secret, `ss_1`, and iteratively continues generating ephemeral keys and shared secrets
  using a blinding factor as described in [BOLT 9](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/7f53a3e46ed59f19463447d5fa63b3e484c708a5/04-onion-routing.md?plain=1#L715).
